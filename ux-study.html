					<p>The study examined the use of Apple’s Siri voice assistant for the purpose of trip-planning for frequent long-distance travelers. The goal was to determine what attitudinal and usability obstacles users faced when using Siri for basic tasks associated with planning a trip, in order to discover ways to improve the experience for future users. We also wanted to know if and how assumptions made by new or infrequent Siri-users could be used to facilitate feature discovery in future versions of Siri. </p>

					<p class="p-group">Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Internet has become one of the most effective ways for individuals to seek information about travel. However, frequent travelers claim that they are often overwhelmed by the huge amount of information available online and at times struggle to find what they are looking for, causing trip-planning to be a frustrating experience. [1] Considering the complexity involved with planning a trip online, we were inspired to investigate how a natural language user interface technology such as Apple’s Siri can assist with tasks related to trip-planning. </p>
					<p>The research team that conducted the usability tests consisted of three MHCID graduate students at the University of Washington. The usability tests were conducted in a quiet office space on November 30 and December 1 using iOS version 10.1.1 of Siri on the iPhone. The findings of the usability test are recorded in this document. </p>

					<p>Our participants were recruited from a Facebook group called HCDE Peeps (a group for students and alumni of the HCDE department) and from the MHCID program at the University of Washington. We recruited four participants total, two of which were full-time graduate students at the University of Washington. The other two participants were non-student, working individuals who live in Seattle, WA.</p>

					<p>Each usability test lasted approximately 30 minutes. During the test, the facilitator brie y interviewed each participant about their travel habits, had them complete four tasks, and then closed the interview with questions regarding their impressions of using Siri.</p>
					<p>Before and after each task, the facilitator asked the participant to rate the task on a 5-point Likert scale with measures ranging from Very Easy (1) to Very Difficult (5), in order to understand the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>How difficult the participants anticipated using Siri will be.</li>
						<li>How difficult the participant felt using Siri actually was after the task.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>After each task was completed, the facilitator asked the participant to rate their experience of using Siri for the task on a 5-point Likert scale with measures ranging from Very Unsatisfied (1) and Very Satisfied (5) for subjective measures including: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>How confident they were in completing the task.</li>
						<li>If the results from the task were useful or relevant. </li>
						<li>How many times they had to attempts the task.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In addition, the facilitator asked the participants the following after each task:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Overall impressions of using Siri </li>
						<li>Difficulty in understanding Siri </li>
						<li>Difficult being understood by Siri</li>
						<li>Surprises by what Siri could or could not do </li>
						<li>Changes they would make to Siri </li>
						<li>Using Siri for trip-planning in the future</li>
					</ul>
					<h6>Data Collection</h6>
					<p>The facilitator used her iPhone as the testing phone, which participants used to engage in the test. The test phone captured participants’ text messages sent using Siri while the note-taker documented hand-written notes and quotes from participants. The third researcher took photos of the participants using Siri during the session. The notes recorded were the main source of data collected as there were no audio or video recordings made.</p>
