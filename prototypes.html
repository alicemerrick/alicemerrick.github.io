                <p>BorderLion is a mood-tracking tool for people with Borderline Personality Disorder, but can also be used for other emotion disregulation disorders and may have applications for pain management for other chronic illnesses.</p>
                <p>For people who suffer from BPD, seemingly minor incidents can feel world-ending. Afterwards, they may not even remember why they were upset. There is no cure for BPD but there are treatments. Most treatments depend to a certain degree on self-monitoring, even simply observing your emotional state. BorderLion is a tool to quickly and unobtrusivly record your emotional state to your smartwatch. This data is synced with a mobile app, where the user can see a visualization of their mood over time.</p>

                <p>What makes BorderLion different from other mood-tracking apps? BorderLion takes advantage of easily accessible wearable and mobile platforms. It is not a mobile journal that depends soley on the user. It prompts the user to use it, but not a certain time or at fixed intervals. The user can set an approximate frequency and any necessary restrictions and the app determines when to prompt for input. All that is required from the user is to adjust the slider of the mood scale using the watch’s crown. The user then taps to enter the value. Alternatively, the user could also tap “Later” for the notification to disapear until next time.</p>

                <p>Before I began this prototype, I set some additional constraints for myself as well as what I intended to gain from constructing the prototype.</p>
                <h6>Constraints</h6>
                <ol>
                    <li>Construct prototype from paper using tools already in my apartment</li>
                    <li>Build quickly without getting too bogged down by stylistic decisions or minor details</li>
                    <li> Use as few small pieces or moving parts as possible.</li>

                <h6>Goals</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Test affordances. Make sure features and capabilities are obvious to the user.</li>
                    <li>Do not inadvertandly reveal functionality by the form of the prototype (e.g. the ability to swipe by threading paper).</li>

                        <li>Use the watch crown instead of a finger swipe for user input on the smart watch, because the surface may be too small to accomodate large fingers.</li>
                        <li>In the mobile app, show a details box overlay on the mood graph instead of in a list in order to show that they are clickable or, in this case, “tappable.”</li>
                        <li>Remove the “Add Note” function. It is not necessary for this prototype.</li>

                        <p>The OXO brand is dedicated to making tools that are comfortable and convenient for all users. The design decisions for the final prototypes were influenced by the OXO philosophy and existing OXO products:
                            Ergonomic handle, inspired by many of OXO’s handles, is symmetrical so that the user can grip the stud finder comfortably with either hand.
                            Tilting screen, inspired by the angled measuring cup, provides the user with a comfortable viewing angle no matter what height they hold the stud finder. This will come in handy when looking for horizontal fire studs.
                            Button placement makes it easy to use with one hand even for those with smaller hands.
                            Automatic calibration doesn’t require the user to manually recalibrate the device every time it leaves the wall.</p>

                        <p>Prototype 1, the Stud Finder/Leveler, was constructed from a recycled yogurt container, as it roughly simulated the dimensions and shape of the proposed model. The power button and LED light placement were indicated with sticky foam, and the digital display was shown with tape. Immediately it was realized that when holding the device, a digital display would not be visible. I considered a model that did not have a digital display, however, because it violated the original design specifications, it was not implemented.</p>

A person suffering from a panic attack or other form of emotional distress may not have the time or ability to journal their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The wearable device allows them to capture data that they can reflect upon later.</p>
