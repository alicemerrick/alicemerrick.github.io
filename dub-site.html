		<p>What is the purpose of this website? Why would someone visit it? I might visit the DUB website to see who is speaking this week and where, and maybe to join a mailing list so I will never have to visit the site ever again. Someone else might have been asked to speak at DUB or maybe they saw someone wearing a DUB T-shirt and wanted to know what the letters stood for. In any case, I think the DUB website already does a decent job. </p>
		<p>There are still things that could be improved, however. The carousel photos on the homepage are inordinately large. There is a small amount of text under the carousel that you have to scroll down to view. The carousel movement is also distracting and unneccesary. Scaling down the images and placing them side-by-side in a static configuration would fix both of these issues.</p>
		<p>There are a couple issues that are less ostensible. For one, the “Get Involved” tab is not very discriptive of what it contains. Then when you click on it, there is another layer of menu items. If you didn’t already know they were there, you might miss those items. If you stumbled in there by accident or from curiousity, seeing “DUB Seminars” might make you think you could find out who was speaking at the next DUB Seminar, and if you did, you’d be disappointed. All you would find would be a general description of what a DUB Seminar is. You might find the link to the calendar, but that might mislead you into thinking that is the only way you can find out about the upcoming seminars. Even if none of this confused you, it still seems like a waste of time or mental energy going into a nested menu.</p>
		<p>In redesigning the DUB website, I began by deciding what things I wanted to keep about the old site. I liked the social media links on the homepage so I kept those. I liked how I could view both upcoming and previous seminars and click on it for more details. I also liked how so much was accessible from the homepage, so I decided to further that. I sketched out a general flow map of the information architecture.</p>
		<p>Next I sketched out a couple of key pages and made sure to note where some decisions would need to be made later such as whether it was neccessary to include “Mailing Lists” in the navigation bar or if I could leave it in the social media corner. For some other decisions, such as whether the navigation bar should be horizontal or vertical, I created two versions in Axure and asked users which they preferred or which was easier to navigate.</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
	<div class="col-12 col-sm-10 col-md-8 col-xl-6">
		<p>The participant was asked to complete three tasks. The first task was to log in. From the homepage the participant was able to easily find the log in area, however, he noted that when he went to tab over to it, the tab order was wrong. This is not something I did intentionally in Axure. In fact, I didn’t know if I could do anything like changing tab order in Axure and hadn’t even thought about, but it is something I will be sure to consider in the future. After logging in, the user lands on the the “Edit Profile” screen. I asked the participant if this was expected or unexpected. He said it was expected for the first time logging in, but on subsequent logins, he would expect to remain on the main page  with perhaps a “Logged in as <user ID>” in the corner. One of my questions in constructing this prototype was where to put access to the “Edit Profile” screen, so I asked the participant if it wasn’t his first time logging in, and he wanted to update his website URL or change his profile photo, how would he expect to get to the “Edit Profile” page? He thought he might like a “profile” button next to his login name to get there.
</p>
		<p>The second task was to join a mailing list. The participant clicked the “Home” button (“like a Jesus button,” he said). From there he saw the mail icon and clicked on it to get to the mailing lists. “it was pretty straightforward from there.” For this task, because I had removed the “mailing lists” tab from the navigation bar, I wanted to make sure that it would still be easy to find, and apparently it was.</p>
		<p>The third task was to find out where the next DUB Seminar was and who was speaking. Because in the original site design, the Seminar tab was buried inside the “Get Involved” tab and didn’t actually give information on particular seminars, I wanted to see how a user would go about finding out this information. The participant clicked the Calender tab from the navigation bar and clicked on the first seminar he saw, which led him to the “Seminar Details” page where he found the information he was looking for. I asked if there was a reason why he clicked on “Calender” rather than “Seminars,” and he said it was because I asked him to find information on the next seminar so he thought “Calender” would be more expediant. I thought that was interesting, because I had considered combining those two tabs. Now that I know that they each may have different uses, I would need to have future participants complete tasks that are relavant to only one tab or the other to see what those uses should be and how they should be divided.
